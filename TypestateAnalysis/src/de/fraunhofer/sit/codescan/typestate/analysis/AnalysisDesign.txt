on a call to the ValueGroup constructor, start tracking the object vg

when calling vg.add(o) for some object o, then mark o as being an
	element of vg
	
when calling a non-Object method on an alias of one of the elements
	then mark the associated ValueGroup as tainted
	at this time remember the statement at which the call was made
	
now if the tainted valuegroup reaches the end of the method at which
	the valuegroup was created, give a warning at the above statement
