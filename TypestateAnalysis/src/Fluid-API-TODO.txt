TODO:

	Must map back may-aliases to caller's context;
	to do so, store original parameter-ref in abstraction

NOT TODO:

	extract separate configuration classes for call and call-to-return
		does NOT work easily because of type incompatibilities:
			would need different interface types depending on "call" or "call-to-return"
