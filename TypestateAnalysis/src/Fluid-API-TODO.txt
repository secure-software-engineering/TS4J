TODO:

	separate "abstractions" into list of filtered abstractions and list of unfiltered ones to avoid "done" state


NOT TODO:

	extract separate configuration classes for call and call-to-return
		does NOT work easily because of type incompatibilities:
			would need different interface types depending on "call" or "call-to-return"
