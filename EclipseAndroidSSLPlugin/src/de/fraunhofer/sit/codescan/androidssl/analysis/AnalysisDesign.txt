- Start at beginning of methods onReceivedSslError (in subclasses of WebViewClient).
- Propagate taint for second parameter (the handler). A tainted value is one which proceed() has not yet been called on.
- See if a tainted value can transitively reach the end of the onReceivedSslError method. If yes, dismiss the method. If no, warn about the method.

Flow functions:
We only track Locals.

Normal:
	- Gen 2nd parameter at source and immediately kill ZERO
	- Transfer on assignments
	
Call:
	- Translate arguments to parameters

Return:
	- Report if at end of source method
	- Union:
		- Translate parameters back to arguments
		- Translate return value if present

Call-to-return:
	- Kill on proceed()-call with right receiver
	- Kill any tainted parameters passed to method calls (to implement "must" semantics)
		those parameters are re-translated back to the caller by the return function instead
